# Squash Performance Analysis MVP - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

Your squash performance analysis MVP is ready! Here's how to use it:

### 1. Run the Application

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilshah/Projects/sports-analysis
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### 2. Using Your Own Data

#### Option A: Strava Export (Recommended)
1. Go to your Strava activity
2. Click the "..." menu ‚Üí "Export GPX"
3. Upload the GPX file in the Streamlit app
4. Configure your session settings:
   - **Watch Position**: Was it on your playing hand or non-playing hand?
   - **Session Type**: Training or match?

#### Option B: Direct FIT File
1. Export FIT file directly from your Pixel Watch 3
2. Upload the FIT file in the Streamlit app
3. Configure session settings

### 3. Sample Data Testing

If you want to test the app first:
1. Click "Generate Sample Data" in the app
2. This creates a realistic 45-minute squash session with:
   - 5-minute warm-up
   - Multiple rallies and rest periods
   - Performance deterioration in the final 10 minutes

## üìä What You'll See

### Session Overview
- **Duration**: Total session time
- **Average Heart Rate**: Overall intensity
- **Max Heart Rate**: Peak intensity
- **Total Rallies**: Number of rally periods detected

### Key Insights
- **Performance Deterioration**: When your performance started declining
- **Warm-up Duration**: How long your warm-up lasted
- **Recovery Patterns**: How well you recovered between rallies

### Visualizations
- **Heart Rate Over Time**: With warm-up and deterioration points marked
- **Intensity Zones**: Time spent in different heart rate zones
- **Rally Analysis**: Duration and intensity trends over time
- **Performance Trends**: Overall performance score and trends

## üîß Technical Details

### Algorithms Used

#### Event Detection
- **Warm-up Detection**: Identifies gradual HR increase with low variability
- **Rally Detection**: Finds periods of elevated heart rate and movement
- **Shot Detection**: Different algorithms for playing vs non-playing hand
- **Rest Period Detection**: Identifies recovery periods between rallies

#### Performance Analysis
- **Deterioration Detection**: Uses HR drift, rally performance, and recovery rates
- **Intensity Zones**: Calculates time in recovery, aerobic, threshold, and anaerobic zones
- **Recovery Analysis**: Measures recovery rates and consistency
- **Performance Scoring**: Overall score based on multiple metrics

### Hand Position Impact
- **Playing Hand**: Detects shots using cadence spikes and movement patterns
- **Non-Playing Hand**: Uses movement variability and sudden changes

### Session Type Impact
- **Training**: Focuses on technique and endurance patterns
- **Match**: Emphasizes intensity and competitive performance

## üéØ Key Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Event Detection**: No manual input needed for rallies, shots, rest periods
‚úÖ **Performance Deterioration**: Identifies when you start to fatigue
‚úÖ **Heart Rate Zone Analysis**: Shows training intensity distribution
‚úÖ **Recovery Analysis**: Measures how well you recover between efforts
‚úÖ **Visual Dashboard**: Clear, easy-to-understand charts and metrics
‚úÖ **Multiple Data Sources**: Supports GPX (Strava) and FIT files
‚úÖ **Hand Position Awareness**: Different algorithms for different watch positions

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This MVP provides the foundation for:
- **Multi-sport Support**: Expand to tennis, badminton, etc.
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android app
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live performance monitoring
- **Coaching Integration**: Share insights with coaches
- **Historical Tracking**: Compare sessions over time
- **Advanced Metrics**: Shot accuracy, court coverage, etc.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No rallies detected**: Check if heart rate data is present and session is long enough
2. **Incorrect warm-up detection**: Ensure you have a gradual HR increase at the start
3. **File upload errors**: Make sure file is GPX or FIT format

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum session length**: 10 minutes
- **Required data**: Heart rate (essential), cadence (helpful)
- **Data frequency**: 1-second intervals work best

## üìà Understanding Your Results

### Performance Deterioration
- **Early deterioration** (< 20 minutes): May indicate insufficient warm-up or fitness level
- **Late deterioration** (> 30 minutes): Normal for longer sessions
- **No deterioration**: Excellent endurance or low-intensity session

### Heart Rate Zones
- **Recovery** (50-60% max): Active recovery, warm-up/cool-down
- **Aerobic** (60-70% max): Base fitness, endurance building
- **Threshold** (70-85% max): Lactate threshold, sustainable high intensity
- **Anaerobic** (85-100% max): Maximum effort, short bursts

### Rally Analysis
- **Consistent duration**: Good pacing and technique
- **Decreasing duration**: Possible fatigue or tactical changes
- **High intensity**: Competitive match or high-intensity training
