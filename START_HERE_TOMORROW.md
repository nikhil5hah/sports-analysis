# 🌅 Start Here Tomorrow

**Last session**: Set up backend foundation + Supabase
**Next session**: Test backend, build API routes, or start Wear OS

---

## ✅ What's Done (Today)

1. **Backend Structure Created**
   - FastAPI app (`backend/app.py`)
   - Database models (Session, Point, HR data, etc.)
   - Services that reuse ALL your existing code
   - Multi-sport ready (Squash, Tennis, Badminton, etc.)

2. **Supabase Configured**
   - Project created: https://nvclilppofulqvotedvu.supabase.co
   - Credentials in `backend/.env`
   - Database ready to create tables

3. **Documentation Created**
   - `docs/data_schema_design.md` - Complete DB schema
   - `docs/component_reuse_mapping.md` - How we reuse your code
   - `docs/backend_architecture.md` - Backend design
   - `docs/wear_os_setup.md` - Watch app blueprint
   - `docs/integration_architecture.md` - Full system
   - `docs/multi_sport_support.md` - Multi-sport architecture
   - `SETUP.md` - Quick setup guide

4. **Project Scope Clarified**
   - ✅ Multi-sport platform (not just squash)
   - ✅ 6-week MVP timeline
   - ✅ American scoring first, English later
   - ✅ Manual scoring for data collection
   - ✅ ML in v2 (after 50+ sessions)
   - ✅ All insights in mobile app (no Streamlit in product)

## 🚀 Tomorrow Morning - Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Option A: Test the Backend ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Goal**: Make sure everything works before building more

```bash
# 1. Go to backend directory
cd ~/Projects/sports-analysis/backend

# 2. Activate virtual environment (if you use one)
source venv/bin/activate  # or: source env/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies (if not done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the server
python app.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Database initialized
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Then test:**
```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should see:
# {"status": "healthy", "database": "connected", ...}
```

**Check Supabase Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nvclilppofulqvotedvu/editor
- You should see tables created: `users`, `sessions`, `points`, etc.

✅ **If this works → Backend is ready!**

---

### Option B: Build API Routes

**Goal**: Create REST endpoints to actually use the backend

I can help you build:
- `POST /api/sessions` - Create new session
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/points` - Record point
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}/insights` - Get analytics
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/upload` - Upload FIT file

**Time estimate**: 2-3 hours to build all routes

---

### Option C: Start Wear OS App

**Goal**: Begin building the watch app

**Prerequisites:**
- Install Android Studio
- Set up Pixel Watch 3 emulator
- Kotlin knowledge

**Time estimate**: Half day to get basic structure

---

## 📋 What You Need to Decide Tomorrow

### Question 1: Test Backend First or Build More?

**Option A (Recommended)**: Test what we built today
- Pro: Validate architecture before building more
- Pro: Catch any issues early
- Con: No new visible features yet

**Option B**: Keep building (API routes or Wear OS)
- Pro: Faster visible progress
- Con: Might need to debug later

### Question 2: Backend or Wear OS Next?

**Backend-first approach:**
- Week 1-2: Finish backend (API + deploy)
- Week 3-4: Build Wear OS
- Week 5-6: Build mobile app
- Pro: Can test backend independently
- Pro: Clear progression

**Wear OS-first approach:**
- Week 1-2: Build Wear OS (local storage)
- Week 3-4: Finish backend
- Week 5-6: Connect everything + mobile
- Pro: Most unique component first
- Pro: Can test watch features offline

## 🐛 If You Hit Issues Tomorrow

### "Cannot connect to database"
Check `backend/.env`:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` filled in?
- `DATABASE_URL` has correct password?

### "Import errors"
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Tables not creating"
The app creates tables automatically on first run. If it fails:
1. Check Supabase project is running (green in dashboard)
2. Check database password is correct
3. Look for error message in terminal

## 💡 Quick Wins for Tomorrow

If you want fast visible progress:

1. **Test backend** (15 min) → Validates everything
2. **Create test script** (30 min) → I can write this - simulates a session
3. **Build one API endpoint** (1 hour) → `POST /api/sessions`
4. **Deploy to Railway** (30 min) → Get it live!

Any of these would be a solid "Day 2" accomplishment.

## 🎯 Remember the Goal

**6-week MVP:**
- Week 1-2: Backend ✅ (halfway done!)
- Week 3-4: Wear OS (manual scoring + HR)
- Week 5-6: Mobile app (all insights)

**You're on track!** 🚀

## 📞 When You Return

Just ping me with:
- "Let's test the backend"
- "Let's build API routes"
- "Let's start Wear OS"
- "I hit an error: [error message]"

I'll pick up right where we left off.

**Sleep well! Tomorrow we'll make this thing run.** 😴
